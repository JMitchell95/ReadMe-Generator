 ## Description 
Greetings! This is my ReadMe Generator, a simple tool to create a quick and easy "readme" file. As a matter of fact what you're reading now was framed by this tool (with    some tweaking of course for formatting and all that great stuff). You simply answer some prompts and the tool should do the rest. Enjoy.
